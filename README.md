# Overview

I've played CheckIO for years and seems have reached my bottleneck. In retrospect, these solutions are tracks of my improvement of python. Most of them were developed under Python2.7 and are workable under Python 3 but with aweful style. 

I've decide to migrate/test all solutions in Py3 environment one per day. Hoping this could help more people to understand & enjoy python.
